            Fast & Furious, also known as The Fast and the Furious, is an
            American action media franchise centered on a series of films
            revolving around street racing, heists, and spies.

          <h3>Casting</h3>

          <p>
            In 2000, actor Paul Walker had worked with director Rob Cohen on The
            Skulls. Cohen secured a deal with producer Neal H. Moritz for an
            untitled action film for Universal Pictures, and approached Walker
            and asked him to suggest his "dream" action film; Walker suggested a
            mash-up of the films Days of Thunder (1990) and Donnie Brasco
            (1997). Soon thereafter, Cohen and Moritz brought him the Vibe
            magazine article "Racer X" by Ken Li, published in May 1998, which
            detailed underground street racing operating in New York City, and
            suggested a story set to follow Walker as an undercover cop tasked
            with infiltrating the world of underground street racing in Los
            Angeles inspired by the article. Upon hearing this, Walker signed on
            immediately; finding his co-star proved difficult. The studio warmed
            toward the idea of Timothy Olyphant in the role of Dominic Toretto,
            due to the success of the blockbuster Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), but
            he declined. Moritz persisted on Vin Diesel following his
            performance in Pitch Black (2000), with Diesel accepting after
            proposing several script changes. Moritz had difficulty choosing
            between the titles Racer X (after the article), Redline, Race Wars
            and Street Wars, but was ultimately inspired by a documentary on
            American International Pictures, which included the 1954 film The
            Fast and the Furious. Moritz was traded use of some stock footage to
            its director, Roger Corman, in exchange for a license to use the
            title. Upon release in June 2001, the film shattered box office
            expectations and a sequel was green-lit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diesel declined to return for the sequel, saying that the screenplay
            was inferior to its predecessor. Cohen also declined the sequel,
            opting to develop the film XXX (2002), which starred Diesel in the
            lead role. To account for these changes, Universal commissioned the
            writers to create a standalone sequel with Walker in the lead and
            brought in John Singleton as the new director. Filming was delayed
            by a year and the production location shifted to Miami. Tyrese
            Gibson, who worked with Singleton on the film Baby Boy (2001), was
            hired as Walker's new co-star[35] for what was also the first entry
            in the series to feature long-running cast member Ludacris.
          </p>
          <p>
            Universal attempted to bring back Diesel for the third installment,
            but he again declined due to other projects and a dislike for the
            script.[38] After failing to secure the returns of Walker or any
            other member of the original cast, Universal ordered a stand-alone
            film of the franchise. Screenwriter Chris Morgan subsequently
            attempted to revive the series primarily for car enthusiasts,
            introducing new characters, focusing on a car-related subculture and
            moving the series to Tokyo; Japan contains one of the world's
            largest automotive industries. It is the first film in the series to
            start its tradition of filming in locations outside the United
            States. Moritz returned and hired director Justin Lin, having been
            impressed with Lin's work for the film Better Luck Tomorrow (2002),
            which shared similar elements with Tokyo Drift. The third film
            marked the first appearance in the Fast & Furious franchise of Han
            Lue, portrayed by Sung Kang, a character who originated from Lin's
            Better Luck Tomorrow. Although the relation between Better Luck
            Tomorrow and Fast & Furious was originally left unaddressed, both
            Lin and Kang repeatedly confirmed during the following years that it
            was the same character, and that Better Luck Tomorrow doubled as
            Han's origin story, retroactively making the film part of the Fast &
            Furious continuity. Moreover, with Tokyo Drift, the series was able
            to bring Diesel in for a cameo appearance, in exchange for letting
            the actor's production company acquire the rights to the Riddick
            character. The third film was the least financially successful of
            the franchise, received lukewarm reception and left the future of
            the franchise in limbo.
          </p>
          <p>
            Away from the franchise, Diesel made a string of box office or
            critical flops, including The Chronicles of Riddick (2004), The
            Pacifier (2005) and Find Me Guilty (2006), but his cameo in Tokyo
            Drift generated interest in reviving the series. After signing
            Diesel and confirming the return of Lin, Universal worked to track
            the first film's original co-stars and re-signed Walker, Michelle
            Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster in mid-2008. Walker was initially
            reluctant to rejoin the franchise after six years, but Diesel
            assured him that film would be considered the first "true" sequel.
            Morgan returned to write after the critical praise for the character
            Han Lue. Given the apparent death of the character in the third
            film, the timeline of the franchise was altered to account for his
            appearance.[38] With the emphasis on car culture toned down, the
            fourth film, Fast & Furious, was a commercial success. Although
            critical reception was mixed, it reinvigorated the franchise, as
            well as the star power of Diesel and Walker. Dwayne Johnson joined
            the cast in Fast Five and headlined the first spin-off film.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2011, Fast Five was released. While developing the film,
            Universal completely departed from any street racing elements
            prevalent in previous films, to transform the franchise into a heist
            action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract
            wider audiences that might otherwise be put off by a heavy emphasis
            on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional
            film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more
            attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls and the
            heist. Fast Five was initially conceived to conclude the franchise,
            but following positive reception at test screenings, alongside its
            eventual strong critical and commercial performance, Universal
            proceeded to develop a sixth film.Furthermore, the film is noted for
            the addition of Dwayne Johnson to the cast, whose performance was
            critically praised.
          </p>
          <p>
            In late 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that Universal was
            approaching the sixth and seventh installment with a single
            storyline running through both films, with Morgan envisaging themes
            of freedom and family, but later shifted to account for the studio's
            wishes to incorporate elements of espionage. Lin revealed that he
            had, after discussions with Diesel, storyboarded, previsualized and
            began editing a twelve-minute finale for Fast & Furious 6, before
            filming was completed on Fast Five. Upon release, the sixth film
            became the highest-grossing film in the series, grossing $788
            million worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Universal lacked a major event film for 2014 and rushed the seventh
            film into pre-production in mid-2013 due to its status as a bankable
            asset. Lin decided not to return to direct the seventh film, as he
            was still performing post-production on Fast & Furious 6. James Wan,
            primarily known for horror films, took over directorial duties. In
            November 2013, Walker died in a car crash, and the seventh film was
            delayed to 2015 that December. His brothers Caleb and Cody were
            hired as stand-ins to recreate Walker's likeness using CGI,
            reworking his character arc as "retired". Furious 7 (2015) was
            released to critical and commercial success as the
            third-highest-grossing film of 2015. Universal unveiled plans for
            three sequels to Furious 7 in November 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            The toll of multiple re-shoots dissuaded Wan from returning to the
            franchise and Universal hired F. Gary Gray to helm the eighth film,
            The Fate of the Furious. This film was to begin a new trilogy to
            conclude the franchise. The film was released in 2017 and received
            mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the performances
            and action sequences, but criticized the storyline and the long
            running time. It was an unabashed commercial success, grossing over
            $1.2 billion worldwide. Universal later announced that final two
            films will be released in May 2020 and April 2021, with Lin
            returning to direct. It was announced that Brewster would reprise
            her role as Mia Toretto, while screenwriter Daniel Casey was hired
            for the ninth film; F9 is the first film since Tokyo Drift not to be
            written by Morgan. Pre-production began in February 2019 in London,
            and filming began in June and concluded in November. John Cena was
            cast as the film's villain, portraying Jakob Toretto, Dom's brother.
            Moreover, Sung Kang returned as Han, while the film is the first to
            star Helen Mirren and saw Lucas Black reprise his role as Sean
            Boswell from Tokyo Drift. F9 was originally scheduled to be
            theatrically released on May 22, 2020, but was pushed back a year to
            April 2, 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[66] It was then pushed
            back to May 28, 2021, and finally released in the United States on
            June 25. It broke pandemic box office records, grossing $726 million
            worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast X was designed to be the final movie of the franchise which
            later evolved in becoming a two part finale. Justin Lin was brought
            back to direct both movies but left the process early on due to on
            set differences with Vin Diesel.[69] Louis Leterrier was then hired
            as his replacement to direct the two part finale. At Universal's
            request, the two part finale was changed to a trilogy.

            <strong> X: Part 2 (2027)</strong>
            On April 19, 2023, Louis Leterrier was announced as the director of
            an untitled sequel to Fast X and Hobbs & Reyes,[4] while Christina
            Hodson and Oren Uziel were announced as screenwriters five days
            later.[5] Later that month at CinemaCon, Vin Diesel revealed the
            eleventh film would be released in 2025.The project was put on hold
            due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes.
            While Fast X led the development of the eleventh film, its budget
            and modest box office performance meant that the project's
            continuation would serve as a finale. It was reported that an
            eleventh film could be "a throwback to the original film", and
            consist of a single mission and a different antagonist instead of
            Dante. In February 2024, Diesel confirmed that the eleventh film
            would be the final installment.[10] In May 2024, Leterrier announced
            that the film was delayed to 2026.[11] The next month, it was
            announced that Zach Dean replaced Hodson and Uziel as the writer. In
            November 2024, it was announced that the film would be released in
            March 2026. In June 2025, Diesel announced the film would now
            release in April 2027, claiming the film will go back to the roots
            of the franchise, while also saying that Brian O'Conner was due to
            return.

            <strong>Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Reyes (TBA)</strong>
            In November 2019, producer Hiram Garcia confirmed that all creatives
            involved have intentions in developing a sequel to Hobbs & Shaw,
            with conversations regarding the project ongoing.[15] By March 2020,
            Dwayne Johnson confirmed that a sequel was officially in
            development, while the creative team was not yet decided.[16] Garcia
            confirmed the project was in active development a month later,
            citing the box office performance of Hobbs & Shaw, and announced
            Chris Morgan would return to write.[17][18] Johnson expressed
            excitement for the sequel that same month, stating that it will
            introduce new characters.[19] In November 2021, Johnson revealed
            that he had developed an original idea for the sequel, which he
            described as "the antithesis of Fast & Furious" and that he
            presented the concept to Universal Pictures chairwoman Donna
            Langley, as well as Garcia and Morgan. He elaborated the sequel
            would take immediate precedence over the rest of his film-slate, and
            further teased its development would progress after he completed the
            holiday-action film Red One (2024).[20] Later that month, Garcia
            confirmed that work on the screenplay is ongoing, calling the film
            "very ambitious".[21] In December 2022, Universal Pictures producer
            Kelly McCormick stated the film's production has been stalled.[22]
            In June 2023, Johnson announced plans for a direct Hobbs & Shaw
            sequel were postponed, and that a standalone sequel serving as a
            direct continuation to Fast X (2023) that would bridge into the
            eleventh main film was in development.[23] The film's title, Hobbs &
            Reyes, was then announced, with Johnson and Jason Momoa set to
            star.[24] Morgan was set to return to write the film, with Garcia,
            Johnson, Dany Garcia, Vin Diesel, Samantha Vincent, Jeff
            Kirschenbaum, and Neal H. Moritz set to produce.

            <strong><em>Spin-offs</em></strong>
            In 2015, Diesel announced that potential spin-offs were in the early
            stages of development. In 2019, Diesel announced a film that will
            focus on the women characters from the Fast & Furious and mentioned
            that there are three spin-off films in development. Nicole Perlman,
            Lindsey Anderson Beer and Geneva Robertson-Dworet will serve as
            co-screenwriters on the project. The first spin-off, Fast & Furious
            Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, was announced in 2018 and starred Johnson
            and Jason Statham. In late 2017, Variety reported Morgan had written
            the script, while David Leitch would direct. Originally, the ninth
            film in the main series was supposed to be released in April 2019,
            followed by the tenth in April 2021. Instead, Universal opted to
            proceed with the spin-off, to occupy the 2019 release date. This
            caused tensions between Johnson, Diesel and Gibson,[76] with Gibson
            responding through an Instagram post, criticizing Johnson for
            causing the ninth film to be delayed.[73] Johnson called out his
            male co-stars after completing The Fate of the Furious in a now
            deleted Instagram post saying, "My male co-stars however are a
            different story. Some conduct themselves as stand up men and true
            professionals, while others don't. The ones that don't are too
            chicken shit to do anything about it anyway. Candy asses. When you
            watch this movie next April and it seems like I'm not acting in some
            of these scenes and my blood is legit boiling—you're right."[77]
            Johnson later cited scheduling issues as his refusal to participate
            in F9 and later confirmed he will not be in the final two Fast &
            Furious films (Fast X and its sequel), despite Vin Diesel asking him
            to return in an Instagram post, with Johnson calling Diesel's
            attempt "manipulative".[78] However, Johnson made a cameo appearance
            at the end of Fast X which indicated his potential involvement in
            its sequel.[79] In October 2018, long-term producer Neal H. Moritz
            filed a lawsuit against Universal Pictures for breach of oral
            contract and committing promissory fraud, after the distributor
            removed him as lead producer for Hobbs & Shaw. Furthermore, it was
            revealed in May 2019 that Universal had dropped Moritz from all
            future Fast & Furious installments.[80] His lawsuit was settled in
            September 2020,[81] and Moritz would later return to the series with
            F9. In April 2016, DreamWorks Animation was acquired by NBCUniversal
            for $3.8 billion, with the acquisition including a first look deal
            with the company to produce animated projects based on or with films
            under the Universal Pictures banner.

            <strong><em>Television Series</em></strong> In April 2018, streaming
            service Netflix green-lit the series Fast & Furious Spy Racers, with
            Bret Haaland, Neal H. Mortiz, Vin Diesel, Tim Hedrick and Chris
            Morgan as executive producers and Hedrick and Haaland as
            showrunners. The series premiered on December 26, 2019, and ran for
            six seasons.

            <strong><em>Video Games</em></strong> A video game based on the
            first movie was planned to be released in November 2003 for the
            PlayStation 2 and in 2004 for the Xbox, but was cancelled for
            unknown reasons. It was planned to be developed by Genki and
            published by Vivendi Universal Games under the Universal Interactive
            label.[139] The arcade racing game The Fast and the Furious, loosely
            based on the first installment, was released in 2004 by Raw
            Thrills.[140] It was designed by Eugene Jarvis, the creator of the
            Cruis'n series of games, and shares much of the same gameplay. It
            was ported to the Wii without the Fast & Furious license as Cruis'n
            in 2007. Three arcade sequels followed, The Fast and the Furious:
            Drift in 2007, drawing on elements of the third film,[141] Fast &
            Furious: SuperCars in 2011,[142] and Fast & Furious Arcade in
            2022.[143] A 2006 game The Fast and the Furious was released for the
            PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable and drew heavy inspiration
            from Tokyo Drift. It received mixed reviews and sold moderately. A
            mobile game also titled The Fast and the Furious was likewise
            released in 2004, followed by a sequel, 2 Fast 2 Furious, released
            in the same year exclusively for mobile phones and based on the
            second film. Several other games have been released for iOS and
            Android devices, including Fast & Furious, Fast Five, Fast &
            Furious: Adrenaline, Fast & Furious 6: The Game, Fast & Furious:
            Legacy and Fast & Furious Takedown. Fast & Furious: Showdown was
            released in 2013 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii
            U, and Nintendo 3DS. It marked the second game for consoles, and
            players controls multiple characters; its narrative was designed
            around the gap between the fifth and sixth film. It was released to
            negative reviews and middling financial success.[144] Various cars,
            locations and characters from the franchise appeared in the Facebook
            game Car Town. In 2015, in a deal with Microsoft Studios, an
            expansion of Forza Horizon 2 was released for Xbox 360 and Xbox One,
            titled Forza Horizon 2 Presents: Fast & Furious. It was released to
            promote Furious 7 and received generally positive reception,
            although some critics lamented the limited involvement from the
            titular characters. In 2017, the vehicular soccer game Rocket League
            released a downloadable content (DLC) pack in promotion for The Fate
            of the Furious, where players would be able to purchase the Dodge
            Charger from the film as well as its exclusive wheels and six other
            new customizations.[146] Fast & Furious Crossroads was announced at
            The Game Awards 2019. The game was originally scheduled for release
            in May 2020 but was delayed due to logistical problems caused by the
            COVID-19 pandemic. It was eventually released for Microsoft Windows,
            PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on August 7, 2020[148] to largely
            negative reception.Fast & Furious Spy Racers: Rise of SH1FT3R was
            released in 2021. The 2023 release Hot Wheels Unleashed 2:
            Turbocharged features crossover themed vehicles from the
            franchise,[151] followed by a car pack expansion of the game Forza
            Horizon 5 released in December 2023, featuring five vehicles from
            Fast X.

            <strong><em>Toys</em></strong> In 2002, RadioShack sold ZipZaps
            micro radio-controlled car versions of cars from the first
            film,[153] while diecast metal manufacturer Racing Champions
            released replicas of cars from the first two installments in
            different scales from 1/18 to 1/64, in 2004. AMT Ertl rivaled the
            cars released by Racing Champions by producing 1/24-scale plastic
            model kits in 2004, while Johnny Lightning, under the JL Full
            Throttle Brand, released 1/64 and 1/24 models of the cars from Tokyo
            Drift. These models were designed by renowned diecast designer Eric
            Tscherne. In 2011, Universal licensed the company Greenlight to sell
            model cars from all films in anticipation for Fast Five.[155] Since
            2013, Hot Wheels has released 1/64 models of every car from and
            since the sixth installment.[156] In 2020, LEGO produced a set in

            The series, particularly the first few films, helped popularize the
            import scene and car tuning.[169] According to the LA Times, there
            are some Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers who blame the
            Fast & Furious films for popularizing street racing in the city. In
            August 2022, residents of Los Angeles held a protest against the
            filming of Fast X, claiming the movies promote illegal street
            racing. The franchise has been credited with increasing onscreen
            diversity, and has had broad appeal across multiple demographics.
            Furious 7 was one of the few American blockbusters which had a
            majority non-White viewership: 37 percent of its audience was
            reportedly Latino; 25 percent White; 24 percent Black; and 10
            percent was Asian. In a 2011 article about the series's casting,
            Wesley Morris wrote: Movies about race still tend to be
            self-congratulatory or mine tension for comedy ... The Fast and
            Furious movies, by contrast, are free of this angst. They're
            basically a prolonged party for a ring of street-racing urban car
            thieves.
